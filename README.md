# vr-dot-cwervo

This repo is meant to replace both:

- https://github.com/andrescuervo/vr.cwervo.com (Ruby middleman implementation)
- https://github.com/andrescuervo/vr.cwervo (buggy Reagent implementation)

This site instead runs on [Perun](https://github.com/hashobject/perun),
a  [Boot](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot)-based static site generator.

You can start up a server using:

```
boot dev
```

Make a build with:

```
boot build
```

----

~~One current annoyance is that you have to copy `resources/public/images/` over
to `target/public/`~~ Nope! Solved by adding the "resources" to `build.boot`'s
`:source-paths` vector :).

---

# TODOS:

- [ ] port over the homepage
- [ ] add a couple of the panorama scenes, etc.
- [ ] and then, finally add the vr-capstone scene so you can iterate on it using Clojure forms üòç
